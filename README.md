### Optimistic UI Update

Make sure you implement **optimistic updates** to provide a smooth user experience. With optimistic UI, the interface updates instantly, providing quick feedback to the user, even before the server confirms the changes.

### Technology Requirements

- **Use TypeScript**: Ensure all code is written in TypeScript to catch errors early and provide better type safety.
- **Use React Query**: Implement data fetching and synchronization using [React Query from TanStack](https://tanstack.com/query/latest).
- **Use Optimistic Update**: Apply optimistic updates to provide immediate UI feedback while data operations are pending.
